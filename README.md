# The Setup

Automated macOS setup for systems engineers who move between machines frequently.

## Why

I move around computers a lot—testing, breaking things, rebuilding. I keep a minimal setup and admire people who can just hop onto any machine and live in vim and a browser, but I'm particular about my workflow. More importantly, I think about security when moving between systems.

Password managers like 1Password make it significantly easier to move around without leaving credentials on disk. If a laptop gets stolen while traveling, it's harder to extract SSH keys, PEM files, or OAuth tokens when they're not sitting in plaintext in `~/.ssh` or `~/bin`. This setup tries to find a balance between portability, security, personal preferences, and speed.

## What It Does

- Installs Homebrew (triggers Xcode CLI tools)
- Installs everything in `Brewfile` (dev tools, apps)
- Configures 1Password CLI
- Pulls dotfiles and secrets from private repo
- Applies system tweaks (see comments in `scripts/02-system-tweaks.sh`)

## Usage

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lonnyhuff/the-setup.git
cd the-setup
./bootstrap.sh
```

Script pauses for 1Password configuration, then handles the rest.

## Private Repo

Expects an optional private repo at runtime. Structure:

```
your-private-config/
├── dotfiles/     # Files with BOOTSTRAP_DEST: ~/.zshrc headers
└── scripts/      # Numbered scripts (01-gam-setup.sh, etc.)
```

Check the comments in `scripts/03-dotfiles.sh` and `scripts/04-private-setup.sh` for how it works.

## Notes

Fork it, customize it. Built for my workflow but should work for yours too.
